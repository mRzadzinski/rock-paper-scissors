<!-- Strive for elegant and minimalistic design, dominating pink -->
<!-- Find fitting graphics, align vertically -->
<!-- Show player's and computer's icons -->
<!-- Dynamically changing borders and size - pulsation effect (quick), satisfying sound (ideas from JavaScript Drum Kit tutorial) -->
<!-- Green or red border indicating who won a round -->
<!-- Interact with mouse click or QWE keys -->
<!-- Reset (during game) and Start Again (after finished game) buttons -->
<!-- Text content: YOU, AI, SCORE 5 POINTS TO WIN, round counter, title (test if it's necessary), short instruction of gameplay with small font -->
<!-- Score bar, indicator in the middle where you want to get (https://tomsoerr.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/) -->

<!-- Inspirations: -->
<!-- Round 1 (top), vs (in the middle, between icons), title font, simplicity (https://jetza99.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) -->
<!-- Copyright, github logo idea, (fix flexbox project copyright) (https://michalosman.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) -->
